I had promised that the *.dat files would never change, but I learned later
that miles.dat as originally distributed used the wrong two-letter state
codes for Nebraska and Saskatchewan. This was politically incorrect.
I decided to change to the correct codes, since this won't affect any
of the data that's critical for the graph structure. Please replace your
copies of miles.dat (and cities.texmap) if they are dated earlier than 1995.

----------------------------------------

Here is a list of all changes known to date that will appear in the fourth
printing of The Stanford GraphBase book. Most of these corrections were
already made in the second printing, and almost all were in the third. If you
know of an error not listed here, chances are good that you can earn a reward
by reporting it to sgb@cs.stanford.edu. [Note that comparison between pointers
from differently calloc'd regions of memory is not considered erroneous; see
the README file.]  Many thanks to the readers who reported these glitches.

Page 217, line 3: the recurrence should be $a_n=(a_{n-55}-a_{n-24})\bmod m$

Page 217, insert a new paragraph at the beginning of section 6:
The numbers generated by |gb_next_rand()| seem to be satisfactory for most
purposes, but they do fail a stringent test called the ``birthday spacings
test,'' devised by George Marsaglia. [See, for example, {\sl Statistics and
Probability Letters\/ \bf8} (1990), 35--39.] One way to get numbers that
pass the birthday test is to discard half of the values, for example
by changing `|gb_flip_cycle()|' to `|gb_flip_cycle(),gb_flip_cycle()|'
in the definition of |gb_next_rand()|. Users who wish to make such a change
should define their own substitute macro.

Page 287, insert a new paragraph after line 4, to wit: {\sl Important Note:\/}
Programs of the Stanford GraphBase implicitly assume that all memory allocated
by |calloc| comes from a single underlying memory array.  Therefore pointer
values are compared to each other in many places, even when the objects
pointed to have been allocated at different times. Strictly speaking, this
liberal use of pointer comparisons fails to conform to the restrictions of
ANSI Standard \CEE/, when the comparison involves a less-than or greater-then
relation. Users whose system supports only the strict standard will need to
make several dozen changes.

Page 288, section 18, line 11: replace "g->uu.I++;" by the code
